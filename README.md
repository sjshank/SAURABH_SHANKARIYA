# Hi, I'm Saurabh Shankariya 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻


I'm a seasoned software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Salesforce Lightning and Blockchain. My interest in the UI ecosystem led me to launch numerous self-design projects which are helping community to learn & build skills. In my free time, I enjoy making short movies, sound editing and experimenting web technologies. Some of my noteworthy contributions are listed below :

1. India Vaccination Statistics https://in-vaccination.netlify.app/
2. Document Notarization using Blockchain https://notarize-document-dapp.netlify.app/
3. Absence Manager app for Leaders https://absence-manager.netlify.app/
